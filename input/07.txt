 The PHP Programming Language

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor

PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge

The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification
